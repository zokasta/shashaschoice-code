=== Popup A/B Testing, Email Marketing Integrations, and Popup Analytics ===

Unlike other WordPress lead generation plugins, OptinMonster comes with reliable A/B split testing and accurate analytics without slowing down your site.

Most of them use wp-ajax to setup analytics. This slows down your site and also results in unreliable analytics due to cache plugin settings.

Similarly, A/B testing in a most WordPress popup plugins is broken because caching plugins can skew the data.

We fixed both these issues with our superior infrastructure, so you can have reliable A/B testing for popups, accurate conversion analytics, and seamless email marketing / CRM integrations for your marketing (bonus: lead storage & lead backup are included, too).
