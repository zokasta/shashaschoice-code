=== ✉️ Review Reminders – Make Reviewing Easy ===

**Customer Reviews for WooCommerce** makes reviewing simple.

You can easily set it to send out review collection emails, days or weeks after purchase. The review form makes it as simple as possible for the customer to leave a review.

It’s an easy process:

1. Your customer places an order.
2. You fulfill the order and mark it as completed.
3. After a delay (customizable by you), your customer receives an automated review request email.
4. The customer leaves a review for all of their purchases on an aggregated form. Reviews can include ratings, images, and videos to increase trust.
5. The review is posted in the standard WooCommerce review format and published on your site.

You can even choose to automatically send the customer a discount code for future purchases as a thank you.

=== 💸 Boost Sales – With Extra Features ===

Did you know that displaying reviews can increase conversion by 270%?

Reviews show that people can trust your site. Other people have bought from you before, and it went so well that they want to share their experience. That social proof is important. Customers need to know your product images and descriptions can be trusted. They need to know their bank account is safe.

Market to your existing customers!

It’s simple: our review reminders keep you in the forefront of their minds, and offering coupon codes for future purchases gets them back to your store.

It’s easy for a customer to leave a review and receive their coupon, which creates a double whammy effect: the customer comes back for more, and you gain valuable feedback. Maybe they’ll even gift the voucher to a friend!

Plus, benefit from:

* Automatically generating new coupons for ongoing customer reviews
* Fair rules for coupon creation – customers will be awarded with a coupon regardless of how positive or negative their review is

=== Get Even More Features – With the Pro Version ===

**CusRev** has two plans: Free and Pro. The Pro plan offers additional features and email support – to find out more and purchase a license, please visit [CusRev’s website](https://www.cusrev.com/business/).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure that WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. If it is not installed, please install [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/). Our plugin will not work without WooCommerce.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress 'Plugins' screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Go to the Reviews > Settings in WordPress admin area to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I found a bug in the plugin. How to get it fixed? =

Please create a new topic at the support forum and provide detailed information with a screenshot.

= How to get Site Key and Secret Key for reCAPTCHA? =

Please visit [reCAPTCHA website](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/start) and sign up for an account. Then, you will be able to get API key pair (Site Key and Secret Key) for your website. Copy these keys and paste into the settings of the plugin.

= Will collected reviews be shown as stars in Google? =

The standard WooCommerce functionality already includes structured data mark up to display your product reviews effectively within organic search results. This plugin extends the standard functionality and adds some extra mark up to help search engines properly crawl your shop. It is important to understand that having a valid structured data mark up in place makes your website eligible for organic stars in Google but it doesn't guarantee that they will be shown. You can test the rich snippets using [Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool).

= How to customize template of the reviews on a single product page? =
The plugin uses the standard reviews template provided by WooCommerce and enhances it with the reviews summary bar. If your theme requires a customized reviews template or you would like to use a customized reviews template for some other reason, it is possible to do so. Here is how to do it:
1) Create a folder 'customer-reviews-woocommerce' in your current theme's folder.
2) Copy file 'cr-single-product-reviews.php' from 'templates' subfolder in the plugin's folder to the folder created at step 1.
3) Customize the file 'cr-single-product-reviews.php' in the current theme's folder according to your requirements.

= How to Change Sorting of Reviews? =
If you would like to change how reviews are sorted on product pages, it is possible to do so using the standard WordPress functionality. Go to Settings -> Discussion menu and find options “Break comments into pages with X top level comments per page and the last/first page displayed by default” and “Comments should be displayed with the older/newer comments at the top of each page”. You can control how reviews are sorted and displayed on product pages by modifying these options.
