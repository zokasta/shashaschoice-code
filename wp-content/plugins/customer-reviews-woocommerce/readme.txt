=== Get Even More Features ‚Äì With the Pro Version ===

**CusRev** has two plans: Free and Pro. The Pro plan offers additional features and email support ‚Äì to find out more and purchase a license, please visit [CusRev‚Äôs website](https://www.cusrev.com/business/).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure that WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. If it is not installed, please install [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/). Our plugin will not work without WooCommerce.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress 'Plugins' screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Go to the Reviews > Settings in WordPress admin area to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I found a bug in the plugin. How to get it fixed? =

Please create a new topic at the support forum and provide detailed information with a screenshot.

= How to get Site Key and Secret Key for reCAPTCHA? =

Please visit [reCAPTCHA website](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/start) and sign up for an account. Then, you will be able to get API key pair (Site Key and Secret Key) for your website. Copy these keys and paste into the settings of the plugin.

= Will collected reviews be shown as stars in Google? =

The standard WooCommerce functionality already includes structured data mark up to display your product reviews effectively within organic search results. This plugin extends the standard functionality and adds some extra mark up to help search engines properly crawl your shop. It is important to understand that having a valid structured data mark up in place makes your website eligible for organic stars in Google but it doesn't guarantee that they will be shown. You can test the rich snippets using [Google‚Äôs Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool).

= How to customize template of the reviews on a single product page? =
The plugin uses the standard reviews template provided by WooCommerce and enhances it with the reviews summary bar. If your theme requires a customized reviews template or you would like to use a customized reviews template for some other reason, it is possible to do so. Here is how to do it:
1) Create a folder 'customer-reviews-woocommerce' in your current theme's folder.
2) Copy file 'cr-single-product-reviews.php' from 'templates' subfolder in the plugin's folder to the folder created at step 1.
3) Customize the file 'cr-single-product-reviews.php' in the current theme's folder according to your requirements.

= How to Change Sorting of Reviews? =
If you would like to change how reviews are sorted on product pages, it is possible to do so using the standard WordPress functionality. Go to Settings -> Discussion menu and find options ‚ÄúBreak comments into pages with X top level comments per page and the last/first page displayed by default‚Äù and ‚ÄúComments should be displayed with the older/newer comments at the top of each page‚Äù. You can control how reviews are sorted and displayed on product pages by modifying these options.
