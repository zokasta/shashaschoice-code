== Installation ==

# **Minimum Requirements**

* PHP 7.4 or greater is recommended
* MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended

# **Automatic installation**

If you set up a WordPress site on Hostinger's managed WordPress hosting account, this plugin will be automatically installed.

Alternatively, you can use the automatic installation from the dashboard, and WordPress will handle the file transfer - you won't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the Hostinger plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click **Add New**.

In the search field, type **Hostinger**, then click **Search Plugins**. Once you find us, you can view details about it, such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by clicking **Install Now**, and WordPress will take it from there.

# **Manual installation**

The manual installation method requires downloading the Hostinger plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here.

# **Updating**

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

# **Development**

Here's how to use the Hostinger Easy Onboarding Plugin's Asset Builder to compile your assets:

Installation: Start by navigating to your project's root directory in your command line interface. Run npm install to install all the necessary project dependencies.

Configuration: Make sure your project's "scripts" section in your package.json file includes the necessary commands for asset compilation. As shown in your example, these commands define how assets are processed during development and production phases.

Development Mode: Execute "npm run dev" or "npm run development" to initiate the development environment. This command will use Node.js and Webpack to build your assets while displaying progress.

Production Mode: When you're ready to launch your project, run "npm run prod" or "npm run production" to build assets optimized for production, again utilizing Node.js and Webpack.

Watching for Changes: During development, you can use "npm run watch" to continuously monitor your assets and rebuild them when changes are detected. This command is invaluable for real-time asset management.
